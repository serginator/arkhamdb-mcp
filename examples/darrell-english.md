## Card analysis

### Signature cards

- **Darrell's Kodak (09016):** Starts in play. Places evidence on enemies/treacheries when they appear; moves evidence to itself when clues are discovered. Provides skill icons (Agility, Intellect, Wild).
- **Ruined Film (09017):** Weakness. Forces removal of 4 evidence or take 1 horror per missing evidence.

### Evidence generation

- **Empirical Hypothesis (09041):** Customizable. Generates evidence when chosen criteria are met (fail by 2+ or succeed by 3+). Can be upgraded for additional effects.
- **Hawk-Eye Folding Camera (05154):** Places evidence when the last clue is discovered at a location. Provides +1 Willpower, +1 Intellect, +1 Sanity as evidence accumulates.

### Investigation tools

- **Old Keyring (09117)** [3 XP]: Reduces shroud by 2. If difficulty is 0, discovers an additional clue. 3 keys.
- **Matchbox (10108):** Fast shroud reduction (-1) for any investigator at your location. 3 supplies.
- **Shed a Light (09108):** Fast. Auto-succeeds investigation at difficulty 0, discovers 1 clue at current location + 1 at any location.

### Recursion engine

- **Scavenging (06332)** [2 XP]: After investigating successfully by 2+, recover an Item from discard.
- **Resourceful (03039):** After successful test, recover a Survivor card (not Resourceful) from discard.

### Utility & support

- **Backpack (04037):** Searches top 6 for up to 3 Item/Supply cards and attaches them.
- **Schoffner's Catalogue (08072):** Provides 5 secrets usable as resources for Item assets.
- **Pathfinder (02108)** [1 XP]: Free movement when not engaged.
- **Shortcut (02022):** Fast movement for any investigator at your location.

### Skill cards

- **Deduction (01039):** +1 Intellect. If successful while investigating, discover 1 additional clue.
- **Perception (01090):** +2 Intellect. Draw 1 card on success.
- **Eureka! (03231):** Wild icons. On success, search top 3 for a card and draw it.
- **Contemplative (11088):** Can commit to parley tests. On success, discover 1 clue.

### Fail-to-win

- **"Look what I found!" (60524)** [2 XP]: Fast. After failing investigation by 3 or less, discover 2 clues total from your location and connecting locations.
- **Lucky! (01084)** [2 XP]: Fast. When you would fail, get +2 and draw 1 card.
- **Lucky! (60528)** [3 XP]: Fast. When any investigator at your location would fail, they get +3 and draw 1 card.

### Ally

- **Granny Orne (60527)** [3 XP]: Unique ally. +1 Willpower, +1 Intellect. Can exhaust to give +1 or -1 skill value to failing tests at your location.

## Synergies

### 1. Evidence engine

- **Darrell's Kodak + Empirical Hypothesis + Hawk-Eye Folding Camera:** Multiple sources generate evidence; Kodak centralizes it for spending.

### 2. Old Keyring + Scavenging loop

- Use Old Keyring to investigate (reduces shroud, can get extra clue at difficulty 0).
- Succeed by 2+ to trigger Scavenging.
- Recover Old Keyring from discard and replay it.
- Repeat for consistent clue gathering.

### 3. Shroud reduction stack

- **Old Keyring** (-2 shroud) + **Matchbox** (-1 shroud) + **Darrell's ability** (-2 difficulty) = can make high-shroud locations trivial.
- **Shed a Light** auto-succeeds at difficulty 0, discovering multiple clues.

### 4. Fail-to-win package

- **"Look what I found!"** + **Lucky!** variants + **Resourceful** = turn failures into clues and card draw.

### 5. Recursion chains

- **Resourceful** → recover **Scavenging** → recover **Old Keyring** → replay.
- **Eureka!** searches for key pieces.

### 6. Resource economy

- **Schoffner's Catalogue** funds Item assets.
- **Backpack** tutors Items from deck.

## Strengths

1. Strong clue gathering: Multiple tools and synergies for efficient clue discovery.
2. Evidence flexibility: Reduces test difficulty on-demand, improving consistency.
3. Recursion: Scavenging and Resourceful provide resilience and reuse of key cards.
4. Fail-to-win: Survivor cards turn failures into value.
5. Movement: Pathfinder and Shortcut improve positioning.
6. Team support: Matchbox, Lucky! (level 3), and Granny Orne help teammates.
7. Stat boosts: Hawk-Eye Folding Camera and Granny Orne improve stats.

---

## Weaknesses

1. Low combat: 2 Combat, minimal enemy management.
2. Weakness vulnerability: Ruined Film punishes evidence hoarding; need 4 evidence ready or take horror.
3. Setup dependency: Needs Old Keyring, Scavenging, and evidence generators in play.
4. Resource costs: Multiple assets (Granny Orne, Old Keyring, Backpack, etc.) strain economy.
5. Action economy: Many assets require actions to play and use.
6. Enemy engagement: Limited options if enemies engage; relies on teammates or evasion.

## How to play

### Early game (turns 1-3)

1. Mulligan for setup pieces (see Mulligan Strategy below).
2. Play **Empirical Hypothesis** early; choose criteria based on your hand.
3. Play **Hawk-Eye Folding Camera** for evidence and stats.
4. Play **Old Keyring** when ready to investigate.
5. Use **Backpack** to find Items if needed.
6. Play **Schoffner's Catalogue** for resource support.

### Mid game (turns 4-8)

1. Build evidence: Use Kodak reactions, Empirical Hypothesis triggers, and Camera.
2. Investigate efficiently: Use Old Keyring + Matchbox + Darrell's ability to reduce difficulty.
3. Loop Old Keyring: Investigate → succeed by 2+ → Scavenging → recover Old Keyring → replay.
4. Use **Shed a Light** at difficulty 0 for multiple clues.
5. Play **Granny Orne** for stats and test manipulation.

### Late game (turns 9+)

1. Maintain recursion: Keep Scavenging and Resourceful active.
2. Use fail-to-win: **"Look what I found!"** and **Lucky!** for value.
3. Support team: Use Matchbox, Lucky! (level 3), and Granny Orne for teammates.
4. Manage weakness: Keep 4+ evidence available for Ruined Film.

### Evidence management

- Prioritize placing evidence on enemies/treacheries with Kodak.
- Move evidence to Kodak when discovering clues.
- Spend evidence strategically: save for critical tests or high-shroud locations.
- Keep a buffer of 4+ evidence for Ruined Film.

## Mulligan strategy

### Keep (high priority)

1. **Old Keyring** — core investigation tool
2. **Scavenging** — enables recursion loop
3. **Empirical Hypothesis** — early evidence generation
4. **Hawk-Eye Folding Camera** — evidence and stats
5. **Backpack** — tutors Items

### Keep (medium priority)

- **Schoffner's Catalogue** — resource support
- **Matchbox** — shroud reduction
- **Deduction** — extra clues
- **Pathfinder** — movement

### Mulligan away

- High-cost cards without setup (Granny Orne, multiple events)
- Duplicate setup pieces (one Old Keyring is enough early)
- Cards that need other pieces (Shed a Light without shroud reduction)
- Weakness (Ruined Film)

### Ideal opening hand

- **Old Keyring** OR **Scavenging**
- **Empirical Hypothesis**
- **Hawk-Eye Folding Camera**
- **Backpack** OR **Schoffner's Catalogue**
- **Deduction** OR **Perception**

### Mulligan priorities

1. Must have: At least one of Old Keyring or Scavenging
2. Should have: Empirical Hypothesis or Hawk-Eye Folding Camera
3. Nice to have: Backpack, Schoffner's Catalogue, or a skill card

---

## Advanced tips

1. Evidence timing: Spend evidence on high-impact tests; don't waste it on easy ones.
2. Empirical Hypothesis customization: Choose criteria that match your playstyle and current situation.
3. Backpack targets: Prioritize Old Keyring, Matchbox, or Hawk-Eye Folding Camera.
4. Movement: Use Pathfinder and Shortcut to position for evidence generation and clue discovery.
5. Team coordination: Communicate when using Matchbox, Lucky!, or Granny Orne.
6. Weakness management: Track evidence count; aim to keep 4+ available.

## Summary

This Darrell Simmons deck focuses on evidence-based clue gathering with recursion and fail-to-win elements. It excels at investigating efficiently and supporting teammates, but struggles with enemies and requires careful resource and evidence management. The Old Keyring + Scavenging loop is the primary engine; prioritize getting these pieces into play early.
